To increment a large integer represented as an array of digits, we can follow a simple algorithm. Here's how it works:

1. Start from the least significant digit (the rightmost digit) of the array.
2. Increment the value of the digit by one.
3. If the incremented digit becomes 10, set it to 0 and move to the next digit to the left.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a non-10 digit is encountered or we reach the most significant digit.
5. If the most significant digit becomes 10 after incrementing, set it to 0 and insert a new digit 1 at the beginning of the array.
Return the modified array.
Here's the implementation in Python:

def plusOne(digits):
    n = len(digits)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if digits[i] != 9:
            digits[i] += 1
            return digits
        else:
            digits[i] = 0

    # If all digits were 9, add a new digit 1 at the beginning
    digits.insert(0, 1)
    return digits

# Example usage
digits = [1, 2, 3]
result = plusOne(digits)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 4]
In the example above, the array digits represents the number 123. Incrementing it by one results in the number 124, which is represented by the array [1, 2, 4]. The function plusOne performs the increment operation and returns the modified array of digits.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the digits array, since we iterate through the array once.
