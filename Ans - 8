To find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing in an array nums, we can utilize a few observations.

Let's assume that the length of the array is n.

Compute the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using the formula expected_sum = n * (n + 1) / 2. This will give us the sum of all numbers that should be present in the array if no errors occurred.
Initialize a set num_set to keep track of the unique numbers in nums.
Iterate through each number num in nums:
If num is already in num_set, it is the number that occurs twice.
Otherwise, add num to num_set.
Compute the actual sum of the numbers in nums and subtract it from the expected sum. The difference will be the missing number.
Return the numbers that occur twice and the missing number in the form of an array.
Here's the implementation in Python:


def findErrorNums(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
    actual_sum = sum(nums)
    num_set = set()

    duplicate_num = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num in num_set:
            duplicate_num = num
        else:
            num_set.add(num)

    missing_num = expected_sum - actual_sum + duplicate_num

    return [duplicate_num, missing_num]

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 2, 4]
result = findErrorNums(nums)
print(result)  # Output: [2, 3]
In the example above, the array nums contains the number 2 that occurs twice, and the number 3 is missing. Therefore, the function findErrorNums returns [2, 3].

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the nums array, as we iterate through the array once to find the duplicate number and compute the actual sum.
