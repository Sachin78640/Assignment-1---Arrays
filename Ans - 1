To find the indices of the two numbers in the array nums that add up to the target value, you can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the algorithm:

Create a dictionary or a hash map to store the elements of nums and their corresponding indices.
Iterate through the array nums using a for loop.
For each element num at index i in nums, calculate the complement value complement = target - num.
Check if the complement value exists in the dictionary. If it does, return the indices [dictionary[complement], i].
If the complement value does not exist in the dictionary, add num as a key to the dictionary with its index i as the value.
If no solution is found after iterating through the entire array, return an empty array or handle the absence of a solution according to the problem's requirements.
Here's the implementation in Python:

def twoSum(nums, target):
    num_indices = {}

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_indices:
            return [num_indices[complement], i]
        num_indices[num] = i

    return []  # No solution found

# Example usage
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = twoSum(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the nums array, as we iterate through the array once. The space complexity is also O(n) since, in the worst case, we need to store all elements of nums in the dictionary.
