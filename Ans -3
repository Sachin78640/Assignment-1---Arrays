To find the index of a target value in a sorted array or the index where it should be inserted, we can use a binary search algorithm. Here's the algorithm:

1. Initialize two pointers, left and right, pointing to the start and end of the array respectively.
2. While left <= right, do the following:
. Calculate the middle index as mid = (left + right) // 2.
. If the value at the middle index is equal to the target, return the middle index.
. If the value at the middle index is greater than the target, update right = mid - 1 to search in the left half of the array.
. If the value at the middle index is less than the target, update left = mid + 1 to search in the right half of the array.
. If the target is not found in the array, return the value of left, which represents the index where the target should be inserted.
Here's the implementation in Python:


def searchInsert(nums, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return left

# Example usage
nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]
target = 5
index = searchInsert(nums, target)
print(index)  # Output: 2
In the example above, the target value 5 is found in the nums array at index 2. Therefore, the function searchInsert returns 2. If the target value were not present in the array, the function would return the index where it should be inserted, which is still 2 in this case. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n) since we perform binary search, where n is the length of the nums array.
