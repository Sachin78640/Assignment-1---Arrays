To determine if any value appears at least twice in an array nums, we can use a hash set to keep track of the elements we have encountered so far. Here's how the algorithm works:

Initialize an empty hash set.
Iterate through each element num in nums.
For each element, check if it exists in the hash set.
If it does, return True as it indicates a duplicate value.
If it doesn't, add the element to the hash set.
If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, return False.
Here's the implementation in Python:

def containsDuplicate(nums):
    seen = set()

    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)

    return False

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
result = containsDuplicate(nums)
print(result)  # Output: True
In the example above, the array nums contains the duplicate value 1. Therefore, the function containsDuplicate returns True. If there were no duplicates in the array, the function would return False.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the nums array, since we iterate through each element once and perform constant-time operations for set membership checks and insertions.
